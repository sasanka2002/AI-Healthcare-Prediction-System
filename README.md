## 📌 Project Overview
---
The AI Healthcare Prediction System is a Machine Learning–based application designed to analyze patient medical data and predict potential diseases at an early stage.

The system processes patient information such as age, symptoms, medical history, test results, and lifestyle factors to generate disease risk predictions. It helps healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve patient outcomes.

This project demonstrates the real-world application of AI in the healthcare domain by combining:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Machine learning model training

Model evaluation

Interactive visualization dashboard

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Early detection of diseases can significantly reduce healthcare costs and improve survival rates. However, manual diagnosis may sometimes lead to delays or human errors.

This system aims to:

Assist doctors in early disease detection

Provide risk score predictions

Automate medical data analysis

Improve healthcare efficiency
